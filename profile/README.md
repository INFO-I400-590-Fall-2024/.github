We are very happy to have you here! In this class, we will build on the fundamental concepts taught in INFO-I300 and INFO-I365, and learn how we can incorporate that knowledge in an *operating system agnostic* mobile development environment.

This organization functions as your submission area for code-based assignments throughout the semester. Read below for necessary steps to set yourself up for a successful semester in this course, as well as references to any technologies we'll be discussing in class. 

# Software Requirements

### Git
**Git is required**! We want each of you to be able to upload your assignments to this repository when necessary.

If you're on a Mac device, Git *should* already be installed on your operating system. If you're on a Windows device, you'll have to download Git [from here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), or via a package manager of your choice (we do not mind how you do it, just make sure you do it!).

### VSCode
In this class, we'll be using **Visual Studio Code**, our IDE of choice. This will allow us to create live localhost views of both iOS and Android devices throughout the semester as we learn to build mobile applications for either platform. 

You can download VSCode [from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), or via a package manager of your choice (we do not mind how you do it, just make sure you do it!).

### Node.js
We'll be using **Node.js** to deploy local variants of our code, as well as install libraries and packages such as React Native, Expo, and more. 

You can download Node.js [from here](https://nodejs.dev/en/), via the CLI (as shown on the linked site), or via a package manager of your choice (we do not mind how you do it, just make sure you do it!).

# General Expectations for Assignments

Assignments will be released *after class* on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and they will be due on the following Tuesdays at 11:59pm respectively. Our hope is that you take some time to reflect on what we teach you, and try your best to show your understanding of the content while it is still fresh. 

Assignments **will be uploaded to *this* organization** in order to be turned in. If the assignment in question is not pushed to the dedicated repository we create for you in this organization by the deadline, it will be considered late. For more information on how to push assignments from the CLI (Terminal or VSCode), [click here](https://githowto.com/). 

If you have any questions or concerns about assignments, feel free to *ping* (@) or Direct Message myself (Chabane), Ayman (@aynnxn), or Mihir (@mihirp28) on Discord. **We are here to help you!**

# Final Project

We will discuss the procedures for the final project later in the course. If you create a repository to turn in your Final Project to this organization, *it will not count as a submission unless it meets the criteria we discuss in class*.
